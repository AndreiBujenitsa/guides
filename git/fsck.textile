h2. What happens to unreference blob

Every single time you do git add, a blob is created for all changed file. Now if you don't commit and make some further changes to the files and then you do git add, then new blobs are created. If you commit now then commit will refer to the blobs created second time.

What happens to the blobs that were created the first time. Well they are there just dangling. No one can reach them and they are of no use.

git fsck identifies those blobs.
