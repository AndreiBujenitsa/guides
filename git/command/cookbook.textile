h2. You have local changes to 'foo.txt'; cannot switch branches.

You might have seen similar message before. I get that message sometimes and sometimes I do not get that message. Here is an analysis.

I have one single file <tt>foo.txt</tt> .

<pre>
$ git co -b lab
$ git co master
$ echo change something in foo.txt > foo.txt

$ git status
modified foo.txt

$ git co lab  
Switched to lab
</pre>

In the above case I am able to checkout lab. That is because the checked in file foo.txt is same in both master and in lab.

<pre>
$ git co master
git add .
git commit -m 'changed foo'
</pre>

Now I have committed a change in foo.txt in master. So now there is a difference between foo.txt of master and foo.txt of lab.

Now change something in foo.txt and do not stage it.

<pre>
$ echo change something2 > foo.txt
$ git co lab
error: You have local changes to 'foo.txt'; cannot switch branches.
</pre>

git complains only if the committed verion of the changed file is different between the two branches. Another way to look at it is if

<pre>
git diff master lab foo.txt
</pre>

is empty then changing foo.txt will cause error.
