h1. git revert

git revert is reverts the changes. However changes are reverted by making anothe commit which is opposite of what was committed.

<pre>
git revert SHA1_HASH
git revert --no-commit SHA1_HASH   # revert a commit but do not commit the revert commit
git revert --no-edit               # do not prompt for the commit message. Just add revert to the beginning
                                   # of the commit message being reverted and commit this change
</pre>
