h1. Do not use git reset --hard HEAD to reset everything

Problem with reset --hard it is hard reset. You will loose a few committs if you make a mistake. Well in git nothing is lost. You can still reclaim your committs but that is not desirable.

I try to avoind reset --hard as much as possible.

To reset everything I just use

<pre>
git co -f
</pre>
