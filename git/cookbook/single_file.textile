h1. Resolving a conflict in merge or rebase for one single file

You are doing either rebase or merge and you have a conflict. It is a complicted conflict and all you want is your version to take precedence over the branch stuff.

<pre>
git checkout --ours foo.txt
git add foo.txt
git diff # to go to the next conflicting file
</pre>
 
In the above case the merged version will have foo.txt from master branch.

Similary if I want their version to take precedence then the command would be 

<pre>
git checkout --theirs foo.txt
</pre>
