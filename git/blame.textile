h2. git blame

git blame helps you identify the author for each line of code.

<pre>
(master)$ git blame config/environment.rb

You can see that first two lines were changed by Neeraj. Rest of the lines were committed by John Doe. Some of the commits by John Doe have commit SHA1_HASH starting with <tt>^</tt>. In this context a <tt>^</tt> indicates that the corresponding line is part of very first initial commit.

<pre>
git blame -l foo.txt                # show 40 digit SHA1_HASH
git blame -L 40,60 foo.txt          # show blame info only for line numbers between 40 and 60
git blame -L 40,+21 foo.txt         # show blame info for 21 lines after line number 40
</pre>
