h1. git name-rev

Someone fixed an algorithm which commit id 33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a. I want to know where that commit is right now.

<pre>
git name-rev 33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a
33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a tags/v0.99~940
</pre>

That tells me that the commit happpend 940 revisions before v0.99 .

Another way to look at it would be using gitk. gitk will bring up visual diagram to what happened in application after this commit.

<pre>
gitk 33db5f4d9027a10e477ccf054b2c1ab94f74c85a..
</pre>
