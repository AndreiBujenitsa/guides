# git creates new objects all the time. If a single line is added to a file then git will create a brand
# new object. However one can ask git to use previous object and to store only incremental difference.
# this is called packing.
git gc

# After the packing is done one can verify packing by running following command 
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-108ebf6abb50656e7aa5695314a47c3fc1e23f90.idx
