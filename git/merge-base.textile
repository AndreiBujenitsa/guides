h1. git merge-base

"Reference":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge-base.html

h2. Common Ancestor

This command helps find command ancestor between multiple committs.

Let's say that you want to know the last common committ between master and lab branch then the command would be

<pre>
git merge-base master lab
</pre>

If you have three commit SH1_HASH then this command will find hypothetical comman ancesor between them.

<pre>
git merget-base SHA1_HASH1 SHA1_HASH2 SHA1_HASH3
</pre>

h2. Find out if a branch contains a commit or not

<pre>
git merge-base e05db0fd v1.5.0-rc1
e05db0fd4f31dde7005f075a84f96b360d05984b
</pre>

Another way to find if a branch contains a commor or not is to use git log.

<pre>
git log v1.5.0-rc1..e05db0fd
</pre>

The above format of the git log finds all the committs which are not reachable from v1.5.0-rc1 .
