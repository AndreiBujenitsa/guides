<pre>
git diff          # diff from index
git diff --cached # diff between HEAD and staged
git diff HEAD     # git diff + git diff --cached
</pre>

h2. What is the difference between double dot and triple dot

There is a difference between <tt>git diff master..lab</tt> and <tt>git diff master...lab</tt> . Here is an attempt to understand the difference.

Assume that there are two branches: master and lab. And this is the current status.

A - B - C - D - E (master)
         \
          \
            F - G (lab)

<pre>
git diff master..lab
</pre>

Result of above command will look at committs (D and E) and will diff that against (F and G).

The triple dot version will not even look at D and E. Triple dot version will take ( F and G) and it will diff that against common ancestor (C). 

Triple dot version is a good way to find out what all changed in a branch since it was branched off. Once again git won't even look at commit D and E in case of triple dot diff.
