What is $LOADED_FEATURES . http://neeraj.name/2010/05/12/require-load-loaded_features.html

# Q
require loads only once
# Q
require 'foo' works
# Q
load 'foo' fails

#
load 'foo.rb' works

#
If you inlcude a module twice then what happens. If a module has already been included by the current entity or by one of the ancestors of the current entity then the second statement to include module is ignored.

#
Best way to add a new method to String and Hash class.
p = Proc.new do
  def hello
    puts 'hello'
  end
end

String.module_eval &p
Hash.module_eval &p

Note that module_eval acceps both proc and string. Above case could also be written as

p = %Q{
 def hello
   puts 'hello'
 end
}

String.module_eval p
Hash.module_eval p


#
In the above case method hello was added from outside the class. What if you are inside the class and you want to add a method called hello.

class String
  include Module.new {
    def hello
      puts 'hello'
    end
  }
end

Note that Module.new only accepts block. Unlike module_eval it does not accept string. So if you have string then you can do something like this inside the class.

class String
  p = %{ def hello; puts 'hello'; end }
  self.module_eval p
end

#
module.constants returns all the constants defined in a module. The list includes the constants defined in the included module.

#
Unbound method works for both Class and Module.
module Lab
  def foo
    puts 'foo'
  end
end
puts Lab.instance_method(:foo).class

class Hello
  def foo
    puts 'foo'
  end
end
puts Hello.instance_method(:foo).class

Also Remember that unbound method values are preserverd forever. After having the unbound method the original method can be changed and it will have no impact on unbound method.
Look at an example here http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/UnboundMethod.html

#
module.ancestors rerturns all the module included in the module ( including self ). Don't be fooled by the name. This method has nothing to do with ancestors.

#
def proc_return
  Proc.new { return "Proc.new"}.call
  return "proc_return method finished"
end

def lambda_return
  lambda { return "lambda" }.call
  return "lambda_return method finished"
end

puts proc_return
puts lambda_return

# => Proc.new
# => lambda_return method finished
http://www.robertsosinski.com/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/
lambdas have diminutive returns. What this means is that while a Proc return will stop a method and return the value provided, lambdas will return their value to the method and let the method continue on. 

#
class Array
  def iterate!(code)
    self.each_with_index do |n, i|
      self[i] = code.call(n)
    end
  end
end

def square(n)
  n ** 2
end
m = method(:square)

def square(n)
 n ** 3
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array.iterate!(m)
puts array.inspect
