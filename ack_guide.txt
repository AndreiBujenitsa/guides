whole world search. I am looking for create_tab. However it should NOT match create_table.
>ack -w create_tab

Search for 'Completed On' without the quotes
>ack --literal 'Completed on'

List all javascript files
>ack -f --js

List all the file names matching given string . This process will not look into the content of the files.
Search through files and not through file contents. 
Get full path to all the files and then apply search to file names
>ack -g form
>ack -g routes

List all the file names where the either the file name or the content has given string. 
It will look at both the content and the filenames.
>ack -l form

Ignore case while searching
>ack -i neeraj

Print line number 2 of every file
>ack --line=2

Print line 2 to 10 of every file
>ack --line=2-10

Pring line 2 3 and 5 of every file
>ack --line=2,3,5

Stop reading a file after certain number of matches are found in that file
I don't want ack to search in a file after 2 matches are found in a file
>ack --max-count=2 neeraj

Stop searching after 1 file is found matching the criteria. This is different from max-count 
in which case search continues for all the files
>ack neeraj -1

Prints all lines, whether or not they match the expression. Highlighting will still work, though, 
so it can be used to highlight matches while still seeing the entire file
>tail -f development.log | ack --passthru neeraj

-v is to invert the search. Get the list of all the files which do not have neeraj 
>ack -ivl neeraj

Do not print the filename in the result
>ack -h neeraj

I want to search for clean? . Notice the question mark at the end. I don't want 
to search for clean. only words matching clean? should be in the result
>ack --literal clean?
>ack --literal .git

Search only through html files
>ack neeraj --type=html

Search all file types including a file called foo.bar. Note that it will still ignore files like .svn etc.
>ack -a neeraj

Search all types of files including files like .svn . In this case all files residing in that directory
will be searched through.
>ack neeraj -u


list all files
>ack -f

list all files with extension haml
>ack -f --type=haml

Note here that -G accepts a regular expression 
ack creates full path along with file name and applies regex on that
since it applies regex on the directory names also the result could be a bit different
search through all the test files
>ack neeraj -G test

Search through only .rb files and make the search case insensitive and file name or directory name
should have test string.
ack -i neeraj --type=rb -G test

List all files which has script name either in the file name or in the directory name
> ack -f -G script
