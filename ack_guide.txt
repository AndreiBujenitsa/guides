list all javascript files
>ack -f --js

list all the file names matching this expression. It will not look into the content
>ack -g form

list all the file names matching the expression. It will look at both the content and the filenames
>ack -l form


-l, --files-with-matches  Only print filenames containing matches
-L, --files-without-match Only print filenames with no match
--passthru  Print all lines, whether matching or not

File finding:
  -f                    Only print the files found, without searching.
                        The PATTERN must not be specified.
  -g REGEX              Same as -f, but only print files matching REGEX.


# ignore case while searching
>ack -i neeraj


# print line number 2 of every file
>ack --line=2
>ack --line=2-10
>ack --line=2,3,5

# only print the file name of the matching files
>ack -li neeraj

# stop reading a file after certain number of matches are found in that file
# I don't want ack to search in a file after 2 matches are found in a file
>ack -i --max-count=2 neeraj

# stop searching after 1 file is found matching the criteria. This is different from max-count in which case
# search continues for all the files
>ack -i raj -1

# Prints all lines, whether or not they match the expression. Highlighting will still work, though, 
# so it can be used to highlight matches while still seeing the entire file
>tail -f development.log | ack --passthru neeraj

# -v is to invert the search
# get the list of all the files which do not have raj
>ack -ivl raj

# do not print the filename in the result
>ack -h neeraj

# I want to search for clean? . Notice the question mark at the end. I don't want 
# to search for clean. only words matching clean? should be in the result
>ack --literal clean?

# search only through html files
>ack neeraj --type=html

ack does not searches the file it does not know about. For example if I have a file called foo.bar then
ack will ignore this file.

# for ack to search all types of files
>ack neeraj -u

# get the list of files ack will search through without actually doing the search
>ack -f
>ack -af

# search only through ruby test files and make the search case insensitive
ack -i puts --type=rb -G test


# note here that -G accepts a regular expression 
# ack creates full path along with file name and applies regex on that
# since it applies regex on the director names also the result could be a bit different
#
# search through all the test files
>ack neeraj -G test
