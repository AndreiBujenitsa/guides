# After the packing is done one can verify packing by running following command 
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-108ebf6abb50656e7aa5695314a47c3fc1e23f90.idx 

# list chronological history of things that happened
git reflog --all

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to find if a file has merge issue
git ls-files --unmerged
git diff # it will list diff with <<<< or >>>>
git ls-files --stage # notice number greater than zero close to end
git ls-files -t #notice M next to files yet to be merged
git mergetool # it will list files that need merging

# If a git merge is failing then use following technique to get more log info
git log --merge --left-right -p

# all the changes compared to ours can ben seen as
git diff --ours
#all the changes compared to theirs can be seen as
git diff --theirs

# compute the hash of a file. This hash value will be same as the hash value that is shown
# in git ls-files --stage
git hash-object Rakefile

# tracking changes after renaming a file
git mv foo1 foo2
git log foo2 # this will display all the log messages associated with foo2 but none with foo1
git log --follow foo2 #this will also display log messages associated with foo1 since foo1 and foo2 are same

git co --track -b production origin/production
