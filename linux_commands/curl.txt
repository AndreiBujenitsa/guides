# -L : if the initial web server response indicates that the requested page has moved to a new 
# location (redirect), CURLâ€™s default behavior is not to request the page at that new location, but just 
# print the HTTP error message. This switch instructs CURL to make another request asking for the page at 
# the new location whenever the web server returns a 3xx HTTP code.
