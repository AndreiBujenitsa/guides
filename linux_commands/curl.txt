-L : if the initial web server response indicates that the requested page has moved to a new 
location (redirect), CURLâ€™s default behavior is not to request the page at that new location, but just 
print the HTTP error message. This switch instructs CURL to make another request asking for the page at 
the new location whenever the web server returns a 3xx HTTP code.
