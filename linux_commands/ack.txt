# Search only through .erb files
# for the below solution to work setup .ackrc file with erb type
# http://github.com/neerajdotname/dotfiles/blob/master/ackrc
ack foo --type=erb
ack foo --erb

# ignore .erb files but search through all other file types
ack foo --noerb

# whole world search. I am looking for create_tab. However it should NOT match create_table.
ack -w create_tab

# list all files
ack -f

# list all files with extension haml
ack -f --type=haml

# List all javascript files
ack -f --js

# only print the filenames matching the content
ack -l before_save

# Ignore case while searching
ack -i before_save

# Print line number 2 of every file
ack --line=2

G# Print line 2 to 10 of every file
ack --line=2-10

# Pring line 2 3 and 5 of every file
ack --line=2,3,5

# Stop reading a file after certain number of matches are found in that file
# I don't want ack to search in a file after 2 matches are found in a file
ack --max-count=2 foo

# Stop searching after 1 file is found matching the criteria. This is different from max-count
# in which case search continues for all the files
ack foo -1

# Prints all lines, whether or not they match the expression. It can be used to highlight matches
# while still seeing the entire file
tail -f development.log | ack --passthru foo

# -v is to invert the search. Get the list of all the files which do not have foo
ack -ivl foo

# Do not print the filename in the result
ack -h foo

# I want to search for clean? . Notice the question mark at the end. I don't want
# to search for clean. only words matching clean? should be in the result
ack --literal clean?
ack --literal .git

# Search for 'Completed On' without the quotes
ack --literal 'Completed on'

# Search all file types including a file called foo.bar. Note that it will still ignore files like .svn etc.
ack -a neeraj

# Search all types of files including files like .svn . In this case all files residing in that directory
# will be searched through.
ack neeraj -u

# Search through only .rb files and make the search case insensitive and file name or directory name
# should have test string.
ack -i neeraj --type=rb -G test

# List all files which has "script" word either in the file name or in the directory name
