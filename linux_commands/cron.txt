crontabl -l => list all jobs that are scheduled for the use

cron jobs output to a file
cmd >> logfile 2>&1
Explanation: normal standar outputs (STDOUT(1)) will 
go to logfile. The error messages(2) are being 
redirected to STDOUT(&1) which in turn is being 
redirectted to log files. It means both standard 
output as well as standard error messages are being 
sent to the log file.

crontab -e => create/edit cron job for the user who 
executes this command

crotab -r => delete all jobs for this user

0 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -r now => between time 
setting and the command put the user who should be 
executing that command
