# extracting the foo.tar.gz file
# use -z option to filter through gzip
# output would be home directory
# x : extract
tar -xvfz home.tar.gz
tar -xvf home.tar

# sometimes this command does not work. In that case just create the tar file without zipping it
# c : create
# v : verbose
# f : output should be a file. Without f the output will go to terminal
# z : gzip the tar file after it's create
tar -cvfz home.tar.gz /home
