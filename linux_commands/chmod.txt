# If you get a new mac then you need to move all the ssh keys from one machine to another
# if you copy all the ssh keys from one machine to another then permission gets lost
# and private keys must have permission like this
# -rw-------   1 nkumar  staff  1675 Aug 29  2008 github

# after copy this is what I got
# -rw-r--r--   1 nkumar  staff  1675 Aug 29  2008 github

# In order to get rid of read permission for group and others just do this
